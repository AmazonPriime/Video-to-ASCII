# Video to ASCII Converter

Converts a video to an "ASCII video" which is where all the frames are ASCII images of the original frame.

### How to use
1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 installed on your computer, can be downloaded here [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download all the files from this repository.
3. Using pip install PIL (Python Imaging Library)
```shell
pip3 install pillow
```
4. Using pip install OpenCV (Open Computer Vision)
```shell
pip3 install opencv-python
```
5. Put the video you want to convert into the input folder and edit the main.py and change the variable: filename, filetype, dim and fps to match that of your file.
6. Using your console/terminal run the main.py
```shell
python3 main.py
```

* Output video will be without audio, but it isn't too hard to get the audio from the original file and add to the output file via a video editing program.
* Examples created from my program can be seen on my [YouTube Channel here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUB0dOhhB1dqw83OfEHX8ig)
